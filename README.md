# Google Drive endpoint

## Overview

The Google Drive endpoint is a user endpoint (see [Global vs user endpoints](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/app_development_model_endpoints.html#global-vs-user-endpoints)), 
which means that each user should connect to the endpoint.

This endpoint allows direct access to the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference),
however it provides shortcuts and helpers for most common use cases.

Some of the features available in this endpoint are:

- Authentication and authorization
- Direct access to the Google Drive API
- Helpers for most common use cases like create files, folders, download files, etc.
